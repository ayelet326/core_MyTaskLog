 * Description:
 * The task management system is a web application based on an ASP.NET MVC Web API that facilitates the management of tasks and users. The system empowers users to create, edit, delete, and update their tasks. Additionally, system administrators possess the authority to manage other users on the platform, in addition to overseeing their own tasks. Integral to the system is its authentication and authorization mechanism, which incorporates JWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication for secure access control
